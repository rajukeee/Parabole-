The approach for these problems can be proceed as follows:

we will divide our approach to four parts and each problem can be solved by these four approach

we will draw a weighted directed graph for the problem.

case 1:

-Suppose we have four objects say object 1,2,3 and 4.
-Object 1 and object 3 is directing towards 2 and 4 respectively.
-if there is an identity relation between object 1 and 3 and an 
other relation between 1 and 2 then there 
should also be an identity relation between 2 and 4.

case 2:

-Same approach can be applied if there is an identity relation 
between 1 and 2 and other relation between 1 and three.

case 3:

-If we have suppose three objects say 1 , 2 and 3.
-if one and three are directing towards 2 and one and 3 have a other relation 
then one and three must have identity relation.

case 4:

same can be applied to three objects if one and three are directing towards 2 and one and two have a other relation 
then one and three must have identity relation.
